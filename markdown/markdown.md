# Heading

The line above is a heading in markdown.

Separating the above line with a **single line of whitespace** lets me make another paragraph. Isn't that handy?

## Smaller Heading

We can achieve line breaks by putting _two spaces_  
after a line and hiting enter. **Wowzers**.

**bold**

_italic_

**_bold and italic_**

> Blockquotes are handled with an angle bracket
>
> Adding a **single** angle bracket to allow a line break.
>
> ### What about **_two_** angle brackets?
>
> > **Two angle brackets** will nest the quotes.

## Ordered Lists

1. Just add the number
2. In order
   1. And indent if you want to nest

## Unordered Lists

- Hyphens work just fine here

  - who'd have thought

- 2\. If you want to start an unordered list with a number and period you can **escape the period with backslash**

## Can you put items in lists?

- Of course
  > you just need to indent with four spaces or a tab.
- this works with blockquotes, paragraphs

        <html>
            <head>
            <title>or codeblocks</title>
            </head>

- just like that

## Horizontal Rules

## Links

Enclose the [link text](app.snowflake.com "snowflake") in square brackets [ ] and provide the link in paranthesis \[link text]\(app.snowflake.com "I've added a title to this one")

you can also use angle brackets to turn a url or email into a link <https://www.snowflake.com> <snowman@snowflake.com>

## images

![ what a great image](image.png)

however that image is quite large, you can also just use html

<img src= "image-1.png" width="300" height="200">
